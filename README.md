# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Tumor Classification using SVM

This project classifies breast tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. The primary evaluation metric is **recall**, with the goal of minimizing false negatives â€” a critical requirement in medical diagnosis.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Name:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features:** 30 numerical features derived from digitized images of breast tissue
- **Target Classes:**
  - `M` = Malignant
  - `B` = Benign

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Evaluate the model with a focus on **recall**
- Support early and accurate detection of breast cancer

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation

- **Primary Metric:** Recall
- **Why Recall?**  
  In cancer detection, it is crucial to identify all malignant cases, even at the cost of some false positives. Prioritizing recall helps reduce the chances of missing a dangerous diagnosis.

- **Other Metrics Used:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if used)
